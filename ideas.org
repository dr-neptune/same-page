make it look more visually appealing
continue working on the simplest domain model

maybe add a much more in depth user auth

** High-Level Domain & Data Model

*** 1. Domain Concepts
   1. User
      - Represents a person who logs into the app.
      - Owns goals (and can share them in the future).
      - Can collaborate on others’ goals as well.

   2. Goal
      - High-level objective (e.g., “Master Guitar,” “Learn French,” etc.).
      - Progress measured by logging sessions (time + notes).
      - Could have a specific target (e.g., 10,000 hours to mastery).

   3. Practice Session (Time Log)
      - Each session records:
        - Duration (time spent).
        - Notes or reflections (deliberate practice focus, etc.).
        - Date/time of the session.
      - Potentially attach images or other media in future.

   4. Sharing / Collaboration (Future)
      - Multiple users can share or collaborate on a goal.
      - Roles: “viewer,” “editor,” or similar.
      - A user can grant access to others for specific goals.

   5. Reminders / Nudges (Future)
      - Remind user of deliberate practice tips or progress updates.
      - Could be simple text, push notifications, or scheduled emails.

*** 2. Relationships
   - User → Goal
     - A User has many Goals.
     - Each Goal belongs to one User (its owner).
   - Goal → Practice Session
     - A Goal has many Practice Sessions.
     - Each Practice Session belongs to exactly one Goal.
   - (Future) User ↔ Goal (Sharing / Collaboration)
     - A User can have access to many Goals (via share table).
     - A Goal can be accessed by multiple Users.

*** 3. Proposed Data Model

*** 4. Example Workflow
   1. User registers → Creates a record in Users.
   2. User creates one or more Goals → Records in Goals, linked to user_id.
   3. User logs Practice Sessions → Each row in Practice Sessions belongs to a goal.
   4. (Future) User decides to share a goal → Entry in Shares table giving another user “viewer” or “editor” role.
   5. (Future) User adds images to sessions → Rows in Images, referencing practice_session_id.

*** 5. Next Steps
   - Implement user authentication/authorization.
   - Build CRUD for Goals (create, read, update, delete).
   - Build CRUD for Practice Sessions.
   - (Future) Implement collaboration/sharing logic.
   - (Future) Add file/image handling if storing attachments.
   - (Future) Introduce reminders or notifications for deliberate practice.

** Other Notes
- testing new emacs config on permutation.
- next step should be to persist the persistence layer. I'm wondering
  if it might be beneficial to switch from H2 to sqlite
  - talked it through with yip. Will stick with H2 since it seems to
    be a standard with java projects and offers similar syntax to
    postgres.
  - update: persistence persisted.

I think some of the lack of movement on this is because I don't really
know what I'm trying to achieve.

it would be good to store user logins with cookies or similar.

adding honeysql for now. The idea of building up a sql query
dynamically using pipes is enticing.
- update honeysql added.

next step: let's add more functionality. I think now is a good time to
explore a minimal domain model and do some db modeling with yip

This works!

I think its a good time to start thinking of a good domain and data
model.

Here is a vision for the app:
This app will be a way to track the users progress towards mastery in
a skill or a group of skills. Think the 10,000 hour to mastery idea.

The user should be able to log in to their own area. In that area
there should be a way to perform crud operations on high level goals.
For each goal, it should be easy to add some time progress toward that
goal. The user should have reminders when logging as to what
deliberate practice is. In the future we would like to make it so that
multiple users can work together on shared goals, and a user can share
results from a goal to anyone they want to specify.

As a user progresses on their goal and updates, they should be able to
log time they spent on the goal, notes from that session, and
eventually things like images.

Can you build me a simple domain model and data model to go with it?
Please focus on high level before we implement code


* <2024-12-24 Tue>

- add formatting / linting [done]

maybe start building a proper domain model
- write up initial thoughts
- clarify and expand them

- use a database migration tool
- maybe look into honeysql and malli?
  - honeysql seems like a good idea
  - malli might be a bit early for now, let's see what the domain
    model looks like first

    maybe add a nice scheduling system in it for reminders and
    whatnot. A cool little use case would be to also make a
    plant-daddy app that takes care of various plant needs.

    update <2025-01-07 Tue>: Kelsey already has an app that looks great for this.

* <2024-12-23 Mon>

Next steps:
- stop making a new database every time. It would be better to use a
  proper db migration tool

- Maybe use something for managing SQL?

- Make a users table that stores information about a user and have it
  join to notes

- add user spaces where a user can make projects which have notes

- maybe try using postgres or something instead of H2?

- figure out some neat things that can be done in htmx that aren't as
  simple in react

- maybe simple auth? So the user can't see / access other notes and whatnot

* <2024-12-22 Sun>
Next steps:

- get a proper backend model working
  - maybe to start we can just store a bunch in a row

- set up a small local database
- enable edits in small chunks using HTMX
  - since we have this feature, we can maybe make a very dynamic built
    up collage of sorts for a layout

- Add real-time collaboration with web-sockets

- add session handling and user management

- handle conflicts for simultaneous updates

- add a proper database. Maybe use more docker compose

- add more advanced text editing

- add user A updated at notification
