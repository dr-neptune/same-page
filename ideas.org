Next steps:

- get a proper backend model working
  - maybe to start we can just store a bunch in a row

- set up a small local database
- enable edits in small chunks using HTMX
  - since we have this feature, we can maybe make a very dynamic built
    up collage of sorts for a layout

- Add real-time collaboration with web-sockets

- add session handling and user management

- handle conflicts for simultaneous updates

- add a proper database. Maybe use more docker compose

- add more advanced text editing

- add user A updated at notification


Woohoo! That works!
Can you make the following changes:
- when a user adds a note, clear the textbox
- make the timestamp only display the date and time. The underlying
  data structure can contain the full timestamp when we move to using
  a database later.
  - currently it shows the full timestamp like so: 2024-12-24T01:18:32.129920816Z
- make the button color match the theme

Furthermore, let's do the initial work to adding a user management
system. When a user first visits the site, let's ask them to
register. For now let's keep it simple, we just need a name to attach
to the notes
