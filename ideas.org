Next steps:

- get a proper backend model working
  - maybe to start we can just store a bunch in a row

- set up a small local database
- enable edits in small chunks using HTMX
  - since we have this feature, we can maybe make a very dynamic built
    up collage of sorts for a layout

- Add real-time collaboration with web-sockets

- add session handling and user management

- handle conflicts for simultaneous updates

- add a proper database. Maybe use more docker compose

- add more advanced text editing

- add user A updated at notification
